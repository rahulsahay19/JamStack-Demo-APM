[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/maherna/APM/_apis/build/status/APM-CI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/maherna/APM/_build/latest?definitionId=11&branchName=master)

This app is built using Angular on the front end and Azure Functions on the back
end with data coming from Azure Cosmos DB.

# Getting Started

You'll need the following installed to run this application locally.

1. Node.js and npm
1. Azure Functions Core Tools

# How it Works

This app uses both Angular and Azure Functions and some configuration is
required to connect the two together when running locally.

![Application Architecture](./app-diagram.png)

# Running This Example

Once cloned, run `npm install` then open in VS Code and install the recommended
extensions. Rename `functions/example.local.settings.json` to
`functions/local.settings.json` and update the database connection settings with
the endpoint and master key from your Cosmos DB database (using the native SQL
API).

Open the app in VS Code and hit `F5` (from the menu: Debug > Start Debugging).

When running the app locally, the Angular app runs using the development server
like you're used to (live reload continues to work). An Angular Proxy routes
requests to `localhost:4200/api` to the Azure Function app that's running
locally.

The Azure Functions runtime is installed as part of the Azure Functions Core
Tools and hosts the Serverless Functions locally on your machine to simulate
exactly how the app will run when deployed.

**The compound launch configuration makes it possible to hit breakpoints for
both the Angular app and the Azure Functions app.**

## Configuration

This example requires a Cosmos DB SQL database. To connect to the database, use
`functions/local.settings.json` to configure the connection to the database.

You also need to enable CORS for local development, which is also done in local
settings as seen below.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT": "https://<databasename>.documents.azure.com:443/",
    "AZURE_COSMOS_MASTER_KEY": "<masterkey>",
    "AZURE_COSMOS_DATABASE_ID": "Product"
  },
  "Host": {
    "CORS": "*"
  }
}
```

You'll need to populate the database with the JSON found in
`src/api/products/products.json`.

You'll also need to update the following files once you have you Function App
and Azure Storage account created.

[`functions/proxies.json`](https://github.com/fiveisprime/apm/blob/master/functions/proxies.json#L8)
Update the `backendUri` value with the URL copied from the Storage Account you
created to deploy the client code.

[`src/environments/environment.prod.ts`](https://github.com/fiveisprime/apm/blob/master/src/environments/environment.prod.ts#L3)
Update `productUrl` value with the URL copied from the Azure Function you
deployed from the `functions` directory.

# Deploying to Azure

The client and server code are deployed to different Azure services. The client
code is deployed to Azure Storage with static website hosting enabled to serve
the content. The backend code is deployed to Azure Functions, which is also used
as the entry point to the application (requests are proxied to the correct
location).

## Deploy the Function App

First, install the Azure Functions extension for VS Code and sign into your
Azure account. Click on the Azure Icon on the left (in the Activity Bar) then
click the deploy button in the Azure Functions explorer (the blue up arrow) and
follow the prompts.

1. Select the Azure Subscription to create the Function App under
1. Choose **Create New Function App in Azure**
1. Give the app a unique name

This will create everything you need on Azure then deploy the app. Once the
deployment is complete, click the **Upload Settings** in the notification

In the Azure Functions explorer, expand your app then expand the **Functions**
node. Right click on the function that you just deployed and choose
**Copy function URL**. You'll need that in the next step. :)

## Deploy the Angular App

Before deploying, you need to update `./src/environments/environment.prod.json`
and paste the URL from your Function app that's deployed to Azure.

First, install the Azure Storage extension for VS Code and sign into your Azure
account. Click on the Azure Icon on the left (in the Activity Bar) then click
the deploy button in the Azure Storage explorer (the blue up arrow) and follow
the prompts.

1. Select the Azure Subscription to create the Storage Account under
1. Choose **Create new Storage Account** and give it a unique name
1. Choose **Create new resource group**, accept the name and choose a location

At this point the storage account will be created in the background. This will
take a minute or so. When prompted choose "Enable static website hosting" and
enter `index.html` for both the **index document** and the
**404 error document path**.

Once created and configured, you're prompted to choose the directory to deploy.
Choose the `./dist` directory from the list and you're all will be built (in
production mode) then deployed to storage.
